# All about expectations 

Below I’ve listed some of the things I expect of graduate students
(PhD students) in my group and also things that they can expect from
me. A subset of this expectations also applies to BSc and MSc
Students. Having an understanding of our mutual expectations is key
to the success of a graduate mentoring relationship. This is meant to
be a dynamic document that will evolve over time with student
input. So let’s start this conversation!


## My expectations of graduate students

1. I expect that you will seek my advice on issues related to your
   professional and academic development (like choosing classes,
   TAships, research directions, funding opportunities, conferences)
   and will seriously consider that advice.
2. I expect that you will use your own judgement about taking that
   advice. For example, if I suggest a conference to you and after
   looking at it, you honestly don’t think it looks up your alley, I
   expect you to go with your gut and look for a different place to
   present your research. Ultimately, it’s your graduate education and
   you are the driver.
3. I expect that you will pursue research that has some overlap with
   my expertise and interests. Otherwise, I will not be in a solid
   position to mentor you and help you have success. If your interests
   shift away from the themes of the lab, I expect that you will
   inform me and we can discuss options.
4. I expect honesty from you. I will not judge you for not knowing
   something or for breaking something in the lab; everyone has
   different educational backgrounds and everyone breaks something
   from time to time.
5. I expect you to be resourceful concerning my time and questions you
   ask. Many things ‘stick’ better when you have to work through a
   problem. And I don’t know all the answers anyway! So by all means,
   ask questions, sometimes I’ll have an answer and sometimes I will
   point you to fruitful paths for answering those questions.
6. I expect that you will respect my time as I respect yours. If we
   have a meeting scheduled, I expect you to be on time or to let me
   know if you will be late.
7. I expect you to be a full part of this lab community. Graduate
   students are the lab members (besides me) with the longest terms
   and are really the heart of the lab. So I expect you to be at lab
   meetings (on time), to participate fully in those meetings (by
   presenting, asking questions, bringing snacks when it’s your turn),
   to come to lab social events, to take part in at least some of our
   outreach events, to help us host visiting speakers, etc. I also
   expect that you will be supportive of each other -- say hello to
   your labmates, help (if you have time) when they ask, be welcoming
   to newcomers, etc.
8. I expect you to tell me when you can’t do one of these things. You
   should typically be juggling just as many things as I am and
   sometimes have to say no. This is fine and I expect you to do this.
9. I expect that you will usually respond in a timely fashion (24 hrs
   if during the work week) when I email or Slack you. I also expect
   that you will tell me when you will be out of town for extended
   periods, in case lab issues come up and we are looking for you. I
   expect you to communicate these things via our shared calendar.
10. I expect you to contribute to communal activities especially
    during infection experiments. This lessens the burden for all of
    us and makes a safety net in case of emergencies (others can step
    in for you).
11. I expect you to invest time in the success of the lab, not just in
    your own research. Running a lab is a huge collective effort, and
    we all contribute to our collective success. For example, you
    might be the one to set up the lab meeting schedule, organize
    hazardous waste pick-up, order supplies, refill the paper towels,
    etc. No one does these things for us, so look around, see what
    needs doing (and that others are probably doing for you) and pitch
    in. I will know and I will appreciate your efforts.
12. I expect that you will discuss issues of authorship of
    publications, presentations and talks with me before
    presenting/submitting. Typically, PIs contribute intellectually
    and monetarily to student projects and are listed as senior
    authors. However, if a project did not involve my effort in these
    ways, I would not expect authorship (and in fact if you do side
    projects that don’t involve me, that’s great. But see #3 above.)
13. I expect you will actively pursue funds to support your research,
    even if it is in line with ongoing projects in the lab. This is
    easily one of the most important aspects of your training --
    learning how to sell your ideas -- and it takes lots of
    practice. I expect you to start in your first year and to continue
    to apply as needed to support your work. Your success in garnering
    grants will also be one of the main features (beyond your
    publications) that any future employers will consider, at least in
    research-related careers. This does not mean that I won’t help
    with paying for your research -- but it does mean that I need to
    see that you are putting in effort to support yourself.
    
14. I expect you to mentor an undergrad (BSc or MSc) or internship
    students at least once during your tenure. If you are here in
    graduate school, there's a good chance that a graduate student
    mentored you while you were an undergrad, and this is the time to
    return the favor (and also to figure out if you want to advise
    students as part of your career). However, I expect you to keep an
    eye on your time and not donate it all to undergrad mentoring. It
    can be a hard balance, but that’s academia.


## Your expectations of me:

1. You can expect to meet with me regularly (roughly weekly and
   appointment). I think it’s important that you have regular
   one-on-one time with me.
2. You can expect me to ask for your honest feedback about the lab,
   your graduate experience, and your perception of me as a mentor. I
   can’t improve anything that you don’t tell me about.
3. You can expect me to give you my honest feedback about your
   progress. I am here to support you in every way possible and giving
   you feedback is one of the most important ways to promote your
   success. If you want to think of it this way, I am like the person
   who will be brave enough to tell you that you’ve got spinach in
   your teeth, but in an academic way.
4. You can expect me to provide timely feedback on your grants and
   papers. A week turn-around time is fair unless it is particularly
   gnarly.
5. You can expect me to listen to your concerns and help you solve
   problems. Some problems need to be strong-armed and when that is
   the case, I will gladly step in. It’s my job.
6. You can expect me to write letters of recommendation for you, given
   advance notice. Please give me one week lead time because I need to
   find a 3-4 hour block of time to write you a good letter. Please
   also give me all the information concerning the required scope of
   the letter (i.e. what does the funding body want to fund) so I can
   focus my evaluation of yourself accordingly. You can do the latter
   by supplying a draft (i.e. also includin the address it has to be
   sent to etc. which will save me time). This draft will not
   interfere with my honest evaluation of yourself.
7. You can expect me to help you network. I will write emails to
   introduce you to people in the field and I will connect you to
   people at meetings. I will also guide you in knowing what to expect
   from these interactions (having an ‘elevator speech’, asking them
   questions.). These things are more important than you think in
   getting a position after your degree.
8. You can expect me to work very hard with you on your posters and
   talks. These are your face to the research community and if the
   audience is giving you their time, you want to make the most of
   it. So I will give you my time to make your talk or poster
   effective and engaging.
9. You can expect me to keep a rough eye on your timeline. Ultimately,
   you are responsible for making sure you hit the deadlines, but I
   will help you plan things out so that events like your third
   semester exam don’t ‘sneak up’ on you.
10. You can expect me to help you find funding sources. I will send
    you all sorts of opportunities and you will decide what to pursue.
11. You can expect me to work as hard toward your success as you
    do. The harder you push, the harder I will push to help.
12. You can expect me to ensure that you have a safe and supportive
    environment in which to work. If you have any concerns about the
    climate in the lab, I want to know as soon as possible. In this
    context, it’s important to know that, as a faculty member, I am a
    mandatory reporter, which means I must report any instances of
    harassment or abuse. However, all information remains confidential
    unless you chose to release it.
13. You can expect me to provide a model of professionalism in
    academia, and you can look to me for guidance on issues related to
    conflicts of interest, equity and fairness, ethical research, and
    mentoring.
14. You can expect me to help you find other resources and other
    mentors when you need additional support beyond my abilities.


### Disclaimer 

These expectations are (not so) specific to me (a first start for this
actually copy-pasted from
http://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/all-about-expectations but apply
amazingly well), but additionally expectations of graduate programs
apply if you are eventually enrolled in one. See the graduate program
guidelines especially about TAC meetings and annual progress reports
specifics. These guidelines might additonally cover things like course
work, publication rate, conference attendance, teaching, etc.
