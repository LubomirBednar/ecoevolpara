Geneious license server (running on beagle)
*******************************************

A lot of members of the institute are using a software called “geneious” to analyse DNA-data. We have 6 licenses which are ONLY compatible with the version 6.1.8 (you can get this old version here: http://www.geneious.com/previous-versions). The server providing the licenses is beagle. Additionally to the license server, beagle is running a mysql server, which provides the “shared database” for all geneious-Users at the institute.
